## Introduction
An engagement bot is a bot for administrating your engagement group, where people can exchange likes with each other.  It will send lists with links that the user must engage and then the user can send his request for engagement in the group.

The bot can: 
- Detect and mute/ban leechers
- Detecting leechers every 5 minutes (not hourly like the other bots) 
- Detect if the user took his like back after a while
- Delete spam and unrelated messages
- Extra privileges for the creator of the group for dropping links without engaging 
- Free

## Instructions

### Create your first bot

1. Message [`@BotFather`](https://telegram.me/BotFather) with the following text: `/newbot`
   
   If you don't know how to message by username, click the search field on your Telegram app and type `@BotFather`, where you should be able to initiate a conversation. Be careful not to send it to the wrong contact, because some users have similar usernames to `BotFather`.

    ```
    Alright, a new bot. How are we going to call it? Please choose a name for your bot.
    ```

3. Type whatever name you want for your bot.

4. `@BotFather` replies with:

6. `@BotFather` replies with:

    ```
    Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at
    telegram.me/telesample_bot. You can now add a description, about
    section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of
    commands.

    Use this token to access the HTTP API:

above, but start it with `@`)

4. `@BotFather` replies with:

    ```
    'Enable' - your bot will only receive messages that either start with the '/' symbol or mention the bot by username.
    'Disable' - your bot will receive all messages that people send to groups.
    Current status is: ENABLED
    ```

5. Type (or select) `Disable` to let your bot receive all messages sent to a group.

    ```

Copy and paste in the bot_settings.py in the variable 'telegram_token'.

*It's needed for the bot to login and check the like counts of the users. You'll get notifications from Instagram that someone from your city or the nearest cities has logged into your account from different operating systems. It's the bot logging in. Don't worry, your information is private and it is stored on the computer you run the bot on*

6. Type into the terminal: 
`bash install` for Linux and `python3 setup.py install --record files.txt` for windows

7. Type into the terminal: 
`eng_bot`

8. To change the settings edit 'eng_bot/bot_settings.py' file and go to point 6
 
9. To delete the bot run command: `bash delete` for Linux or if you're running Windows, use Powershell: 
`Get-Content files.txt | ForEach-Object {Remove-Item $_ -Recurse -Force}`
